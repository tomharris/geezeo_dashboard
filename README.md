# Geezeo Dashboard

## Installation

`gem install rails`

`gem install bundler`

`bundle install`

## How it works

No data is persisted. After logging-in with your API credentials, all data is fetched via the Geezeo API as needed.
More interesting analysis of data and trends could be done if all of the data was synced locally.
